Murphi Release 3.1
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: msi

Algorithm:
	Verification by breadth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 2968 bits (rounded up to 372 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  104 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 278581 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for breadth-first search: 27858 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.
